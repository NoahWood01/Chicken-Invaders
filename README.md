# Chicken-Invaders
 Uploading a rough remake of a classic game I made a while back, mostly to get exposure to python and pygame.

 Simple motion, collision physics, and score keeping.

 Basis of the game is to shoot the chickens on the screen and maximize points.

 Pygame is used for the entirely of this program.
